# Trainer (part-1)
Alexnet and resultant trained NN (for fatigue classification): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LzoUYYbZEy_cNxrh9XJJpJRv38jcvhx_?usp=sharing

This was part of my Bachelor's FYP, and its corresponding FYP report and defense of my idea is provided too.

This repository basically classifies the current accelerometer signal of a trainee as either the athelete is fatigues, or doing it fast, or normal. Additionally, mood of the trainee from accelerometer is also classified from the accelerometer signal, along side with number of reps. From this, progress of the trainee is metricized, and it is forecasted using ARIMA.
